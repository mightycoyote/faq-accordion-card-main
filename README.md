## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SVG witchcraft

### Useful resources

- [Mimic Relative Positioning Inside an SVG with Nested SVGs](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/mimic-relative-positioning-in-svg/) - I ended up nesting 2 of the 3 SVGs used on the desktop version of the component. This article helped me figure out how to do it (but also goes into a much more complex treatment of the topic).
- [A Beginner's Guide to SVGs](https://youtu.be/ZJSCl6XEdP8) - SVGs were covered somewhat briefly in the web development curriculum I went through when I was first getting started, but it's a huge topic. This explainer series from Kevin Powell is really helpful.

## Acknowledgments

Every time I got really frustrated with figuring out how to place the SVGs, I told @thudfactor that I gave up this time, might need to go over it with him later if I had not thrown my computer out the window, and then immediately came up with the solution.
